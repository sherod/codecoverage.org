	<div class="entry__content">In this episode of Code Coverage Steven is off on a bit of a jolly so instead I&#8217;m joined by Jarrod Hunt, a long time BA who&#8217;s worked in various roles and is all to familiar with the perils of working with developers. We discuss:
 The upcomingDown Under Dreaming Conference in Sydney Teaching code concepts to admins: what&#8217;s useful for them to know The role of BAs sitting between clients and developers What developers could do better from a BA&#8217;s point of view  There&#8217;s a few surprising (at least to me) lessons for developers in here, and it&#8217;s interesting to see that some of the same things developers look for a team member are the same as those that a BA might look for.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">In this episode we&#8217;re joined by Simon Goodyear, forÂ a chatÂ covering many aspects of developing on the platform. We got a bit carried away and it got a little long, but Simon has very interesting insights on all manner of topics, including:
 Supporting customers when you develop a product Drinking beer and starting businesses Dynamics! External Objects and OData Lightning development on a large scale Platform limits and innovation Fun and games with managed packages The choice of IDEs available for the platform Damaging hardware and email management</div>

	<div class="entry__content">So we accidentally had another hiatus. This was entirely unintentional and we&#8217;ve talked plenty about recording, it&#8217;s just that sometimes life (and work) happens. We&#8217;re back&#8230; again&#8230; and planning to keep up some momentum this time.
 Steven wrote some code andÂ aÂ tester found some bugs A novel use of reports to doÂ calculations akin to aÂ roll-up summary Matt found a quirk with SOQL&#8217;s DAY_IN_WEEK() function Swatch Internet Time Various tools we use:  Â Illuminated Cloud!</div>

 How he got involved with the platform How he uses the Salesforce StackExchange and what benefits he thinks it offers Mechanical engineering relates to software development Air conditioning patents in the auto industry The contrast between computing in the past and computing today  &nbsp;</div>
