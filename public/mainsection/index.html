	<div class="entry__content">I would write some show notes, but time is tight, hence this is late. We DO talk about Salesforce a bit, with some quick comments on Bob (??) and… something else.
Also F1, because Steven likes racing cars now.

	<div class="entry__content">It&#8217;s a new highly anticipated episode of what might be the world&#8217;s most irregular and/or infrequent podcast, with more waffles than ever. In this episode we talk about:
 Zoom, Neal Stephenson, the ATO and security scares Matt overthinking things and forgetting his Salesforce basics (i.e. query selectivity in triggers) Formula One 10x developers Working out when to upgrade your tools Accenture&#8217;s SF Power Kit for DX Testing Motorbikes, cars and servicing  You can find Accenture&#8217;s SF Power Kit here: https://github.</div>

	<div class="entry__content">In this episode we&#8217;re coming to you live from last year, where we&#8217;re recording at Down Under Dreaming (yes, with a &#8216;g&#8217;): Brisbane Edition.
In this episode we talk more Salesforce than usual in front of a real audience, and talk to both Emily Hey and Doug Christ who was visiting from the US.

	<div class="entry__content">We really do mean to publish more often. Promise. We even line up times and and everything.&nbsp;
It&#8217;s us again, talking somewhat about Salesforce, but with a few (ok, many) inevitable tangents thrown in. Some of the topics covered:
&nbsp;
* Forcelandia and Dreamforce
* Being a male ally
* IDEs and Salesforce (again!)
* Cars and the software that runs them

	<div class="entry__content">Another year passes, another episode gets release. Well it feels like that anyway. This took a week or so to publish after recording because our tracks got out of sync somehow. It sounds like my track (Matt) has been sped up slightly, with a few glitches pulling them back in time on occasion. So, apologies for that. Topics discussed in this episode:
&nbsp;
  Some actual code that Steven wrote My washing machine Dealing with release bugs Mobile Operating Systems and virtual assistants CRUD, FLS and Security Reviews Salesforce IDEs and tools Software development / programming books we like    &nbsp;</div>

	<div class="entry__content">Lo and behold, we recorded again. It&#8217;s almost becoming a habit. Once again you&#8217;re stuck with myself and Steven rabbiting on about all sorts, including:
 Using bookmarks in your browser (bleeding edge stuff here) Salesforce (some new cloud thing) Deployment antics and packages How to break production environments Trailhead, DX and Git &#8211; the new learning curve Lightning experience performance Steven&#8217;s ambitions to be Eminem, certifications and badges Where our listeners (you are very much appreciated!</div>
