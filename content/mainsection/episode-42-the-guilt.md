Promise. We even line up times and and everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s us again, talking somewhat about Salesforce, but with a few (ok, many) inevitable tangents thrown in. Some of the topics covered:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Forcelandia and Dreamforce</p>
<p>* Being a male ally</p>
<p>* IDEs and Salesforce (again!)</p>
<p>* Cars and the software that runs them</p>
