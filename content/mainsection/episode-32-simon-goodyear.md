<p>In this episode we&#8217;re joined by Simon Goodyear, for a chat covering many aspects of developing on the platform. We got a bit carried away and it got a little long, but Simon has very interesting insights on all manner of topics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting customers when you develop a product</li>
<li>Drinking beer and starting businesses</li>
<li>Dynamics!</li>
<li>External Objects and OData</li>
<li>Lightning development on a large scale</li>
<li>Platform limits and innovation</li>
<li>Fun and games with managed packages</li>
<li>The choice of IDEs available for the platform</li>
<li>Damaging hardware and email management</li>
</ul>
