<p><em>Quick note, Steven had a bit of a technical issue with his microphone in this episode, but we decided to leave it in since it gave us a bit of a laugh.</em></p>
<p>This episode on Code Coverage the wonderful Chris Duarte (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/thechrisduarte">@TheChrisDuarte</a>) talks to us about Trailhead. Chris is the Managing Editor of <a href="http://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead">Trailhead</a> at Salesforce, and if you&#8217;ve not heard of Trailhead yetÂ  then you must be under a serious pile of rocks. Topics Chris discusses with us include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Chris got involved with Salesforce and subsequently Trailhead</li>
<li>Where Trailhead fits in within Salesforce</li>
<li>Bridging the gap between declarative development and coding</li>
<li>The content available on Trailhead</li>
<li>What she does as the Managing Editor</li>
<li>Where to get help, such as the <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/forums?communityId=09aF00000004HMGIA2#!/feedtype=RECENT&amp;dc=Trailhead&amp;criteria=ALLQUESTIONS">Trailhead forum on the developer boards</a></li>
<li>What&#8217;s on the roadmap for Trailhead (imagine a <a href="https://twitter.com/stevemoforce">@SteveMoForce</a> Safe habbah right here)</li>
<li>A hint about April fool&#8217;s day. Unfortunately, we were a bit late getting the episode up, <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/blogs/developer-relations/2015/04/introducing-catter-connect-cat-like-never.html">so you&#8217;ve probably already seen Catter</a>!</li>
