<p>Welcome to Code Coverage, a soon-to-be-released podcast focused on content for Force.com developers, where each week we&#8217;ll be interviewing a developer from the community. We&#8217;ll be talking to some of the most public faces but also those behind the scenes, finding out what their backgrounds are, what they&#8217;re doing with the platform and what tools they love to use.</p>
