<p>In this episode we chat with the amazingly productive Dan Appleman (<a href="http://www.twitter.com/danappleman">@DanAppleman</a>); if you don&#8217;t recognise that name then you can&#8217;t have been around the Salesforce development community for very long! Dan makes some excellent points on a variety of topics, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing on the platform over the years and how the gotchas have changed</li>
<li>How the CPU time governor limit is affected by process and workflows</li>
<li>The joys of working with Salesforce support</li>
<li>His PluralSight courses:
<ul>
<li>Apex for Programmers</li>
<li>Salesforce for .NET Developers (short course)</li>
<li>Data Visualisation for Developers</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>His book: <a href="http://advancedapex.com/">Advanced Apex Programming (now in the 3rd Edition)</a></li>
<li>Industry challenges that have arisen from greater levels of abstraction</li>
<li>JavaScript, it&#8217;s use in Lightning, and what it means for developers</li>
<li>The problems with Salesforce&#8217;s ISV program, and how it might impact new developers looking to build and sell Lightning components</li>

</ul>

<p><em>Note: some of my audio and pronounciation goes funky towards the end of this episode. I suffered some technical difficulties that meant I was hearing myself echo at full volume with approximately half a second of delay, <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/120583-new-speech-jamming-gun-hints-at-dystopian-big-brother-future">I think I know exactly what this feels like now</a> &#8211; Lacey</em></p>
