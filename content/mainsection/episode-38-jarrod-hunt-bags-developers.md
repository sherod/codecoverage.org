<p>In this episode of Code Coverage Steven is off on a bit of a jolly so instead I&#8217;m joined by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mrjarrodhunt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jarrod Hunt</a>, a long time BA who&#8217;s worked in various roles and is all to familiar with the perils of working with developers. We discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>The upcoming<a href="http://www.downunderdreaming.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Down Under Dreaming Conference in Sydney</a></li>
<li>Teaching code concepts to admins: what&#8217;s useful for them to know</li>
<li>The role of BAs sitting between clients and developers</li>
<li>What developers could do better from a BA&#8217;s point of view</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s a few surprising (at least to me) lessons for developers in here, and it&#8217;s interesting to see that some of the same things developers look for a team member are the same as those that a BA might look for.</p>
