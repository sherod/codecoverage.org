<p>In this episode of Code Coverage we chat with Peter Knolle (<a href="http://twitter.com/PeterKnolle">@PeterKnolle</a>), a Force.com MVP who works for Trifecta Technologies. Peter fills us in on developing components with the new Lightning framework.</p>
<p>The topics Peter talks about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>How he had to learn to use declarative development first</li>
<li>Where the Lightning Framework has come from</li>
<li>How Lightning apps fit in with the platform in general</li>
<li>What pieces comprise a Lightning Component Bundle</li>
<li>How two way binding makes dynamic interfaces easy to build</li>
<li>How Lightning Components interact with Apex and the rest of the system</li>
<li>Including other Javascript files and libraries in your components</li>
<li>Creating interactions between components</li>
<li>What events are, what types there are and how they can be used</li>
</ul>
<p>He also suggests that a great way to get started is with the <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.lightning.meta/lightning/">Lightning Component Developer Guide</a>, and developers should also take a look at the excellent Trailhead, including it&#8217;s <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/trailhead/module/lightning_components">Lightning Component Module</a>. Peter also has more great content available on <a href="http://peterknolle.com/">his blog at peterknolle.com</a>, including some more advanced topics such as using inheritance in Lightning Components.</p>
<p>Also, don&#8217;t forget that <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/developer-week">Lightning Week is coming up so find you local event and join in</a>!</p>
