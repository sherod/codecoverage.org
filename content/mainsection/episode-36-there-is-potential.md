<p>Uhhh notes, notes, notes&#8230;</p>
<p>We talked about a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trailheadx &#8211; I don&#8217;t even know how to capitalise this</li>
<li>A weird &#8216;bug&#8217; I was dealing with but solved the day after recording, it was a packaged field hiding a non-packaged field</li>
<li>Summer &#8217;17 and how it&#8217;s now fast even in Australia</li>
<li><a href="http://valencedata.com">Valence, a native integration solution for Salesforce that I&#8217;m enjoying</a>
<li>A bit more on Shield</li>
</ul>
