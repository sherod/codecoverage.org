<p>Lo and behold, we recorded again. It&#8217;s almost becoming a habit. Once again you&#8217;re stuck with myself and Steven rabbiting on about all sorts, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using bookmarks in your browser (bleeding edge stuff here)</li>
<li>Salesforce (some new cloud thing)</li>
<li>Deployment antics and packages</li>
<li>How to break production environments</li>
<li>Trailhead, DX and Git &#8211; the new learning curve</li>
<li>Lightning experience performance</li>
<li>Steven&#8217;s ambitions to be Eminem, certifications and badges</li>
<li>Where our listeners (you are very much appreciated!) are located around the world</li>
</ul>
