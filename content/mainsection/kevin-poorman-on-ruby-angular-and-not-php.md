<p>Returning to regular programming (pun intended) after the live episodes of Dreamforce, this week we talk to the unstoppable force that is Force.com MVP <a href="http://www.twitter.com/codefriar" target="_blank">Kevin Poorman</a>. We got to the end of this episode and still had plenty that we wanted to talk about, so we&#8217;re planning to get him back on the show in the near future. After listening to this, we think you&#8217;ll be wanting to hear more from Kevin too!</p>
